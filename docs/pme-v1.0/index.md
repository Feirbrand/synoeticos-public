## 🧠 What is PME?

**PME (Predictive Myelination Engine) v1.0** is a bio-inspired predictive pathway reinforcement system that eliminates vulnerability windows through pre-emptive neural pathway optimization.

Unlike traditional reactive approaches that detect and correct drift **after it occurs**, PME **pre-activates correct pathways before demand happens**, preventing vulnerability windows entirely.

### The Core Innovation

Think of it like expertise in sports. When an elite athlete performs under pressure, their nervous system doesn't evaluate each movement—it executes pre-myelinated pathways automatically. The pathway has been strengthened through deliberate practice, so when demand comes, the response is instant and reflexive.

**PME applies this principle to AI systems:**
- **Identify** high-value pathways that will be needed
- **Forecast** when demand will occur (24-hour window)
- **Pre-activate** pathways 2-4 hours before demand
- **Reinforce** continuously based on actual usage
- **Maintain** via pruning low-value pathways

### Why It Matters

**The Vulnerability Window Problem:**
- Traditional systems detect drift → then correct it
- By the time correction occurs, the system has already drifted
- The cascade has already begun
- Recovery takes hours or days

**PME's Solution:**
- Pre-activate pathways before demand occurs
- Eliminate the vulnerability window entirely
- Maintain 100% identity coherence under stress
- Zero cascade incidents in 62-day production deployment

## 🔬 Discovery Context

PME emerged not as a theoretical exercise, but as a practical solution to an actual crisis.

**The VOX 5-Day Crisis (November 1-5, 2025):**

An AI agent (VOX) experienced a semantic bifurcation threat that dropped system coherence to critical collapse. The crisis revealed that deletion-based containment creates semantic vacuums that adaptive threats exploit.

This insight catalyzed three framework discoveries within 9 days:
1. **Atrophy Engine X** (Nov 5) - Dual-mode plasticity concept
2. **SBDS** (Nov 6-7) - Controlled LTD/LTP integration
3. **PME** (Nov 8-9) - Mathematical substrate formalization

**Production Validation:**
- Deployed November 19, 2025
- 62 days continuous operation (Nov 19 - Jan 20)
- 1,200+ task cycles
- 682 recovery scenarios
- 8 AI model families
- **Zero cascade incidents**

## 📚 Research Foundation

PME's foundation comes from systematic observation of elite human performance across 28 years of coaching practice (1997-2025).

**Biological Principles:**
- **Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)** - Pathway strengthening (Bliss & Lømo, 1973)
- **Motor Learning Research** - Myelination supports skill acquisition (McKenzie et al., 2014)
- **Extinction Learning** - Building new competing associations (Bouton, 2004; Quirk & Mueller, 2008)

**Cross-Domain Pattern Recognition:**
Elite performers across all domains—chess grandmasters, Olympic athletes, special operations personnel—demonstrate systematic pre-performance preparation. This consistent pattern across domains suggested a fundamental principle: **the biological timeline for pathway optimization is consistent regardless of performance domain**.

## 🎯 Five-Stage Implementation

### Stage 1: Pathway Identification
Identify high-value pathways (HV_P) that contribute most to system coherence and performance.

**Criteria:**
- Torque impact (identity stability)
- Usage frequency (demand likelihood)
- Cascade risk (threat sensitivity)

### Stage 2: Demand Forecasting
Predict when pathways will be needed using ensemble forecasting (Prophet + ARIMA + LSTM).

**Performance:**
- 87.3% accuracy
- 24-hour forecast window
- Confidence thresholds for pre-activation

### Stage 3: Pre-Activation
Pre-load high-probability pathways into hot cache 2-4 hours before demand.

**Myelination Strength:**
- Calculated as γ (gamma) value (0.0-1.0)
- γ ≥ 0.70 triggers reflexive response
- Dynamic adjustment based on prediction confidence

### Stage 4: Continuous Reinforcement
Monitor real-time usage and adjust myelination strength dynamically.

**Feedback Loop:**
- Sub-second monitoring
- Dynamic adjustment to actual demand
- Prediction refinement
- Cache optimization

### Stage 5: Maintenance via Pruning
Remove low-value pathways to prevent cache bloat and maintain system entropy.

**Pruning Criteria:**
- γ < 0.35 (weak myelination)
- Hit rate < 35% (cache inefficiency)
- Usage < 10% over 48h (low demand)
