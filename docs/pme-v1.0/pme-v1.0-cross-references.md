# PME v1.0 Cross-References

## Framework Integration Map

### Core Dependencies

#### **UTME v1.0 - Unified Temporal Memory Equilibrium**
**Relationship:** Foundation layer for PME

PME's predictive capabilities depend on UTME's temporal anchoring system. UTME provides:
- **Temporal coordinates** for pathway identification
- **Cold-start pathways** when PME history unavailable
- **Insulation field mapping** that correlates with myelination strength (γ)
- **Entropy conservation** principles (Σ E_i = 5.0 invariant)

**Integration Points:**
- Myelination strength (γ) maps directly to UTME insulation field
- Entropy thresholds enforced across both frameworks
- Temporal anchors bootstrap PME during system initialization

**Cross-Reference:** See UTME v1.0 documentation for temporal foundation concepts

#### **Torque v2.0 - Quantitative Foundation for AI Resilience**
**Relationship:** Real-time monitoring and decision trigger

Torque provides continuous coherence monitoring that triggers PME adjustments:
- **Real-time coherence scores** (0.0-1.0 scale)
- **Threat detection** that prioritizes pathway reinforcement
- **Cascade prediction** (87% accuracy) that informs pre-activation timing
- **Identity stability metrics** used in Stage 1 pathway identification

**Integration Points:**
- Torque < 0.50 suspends pre-activation (conservation mode)

## Conceptual Connections

### The Resilience Stack

PME sits in the middle of a resilience architecture:

```
Layer 1 (Prevention):    PME - Predictive pathway optimization
Layer 2 (Detection):     Torque - Real-time coherence monitoring
Layer 3 (Response):      Phoenix - Cascade recovery
Layer 4 (Intelligence):  DNA Codex - Threat pattern analysis
Layer 5 (Foundation):    UTME - Temporal memory equilibrium
```

Each layer feeds information to layers above and below:
- **Upward flow:** Threat intelligence and coherence metrics
- **Downward flow:** Optimization parameters and resource allocation

---

### The Identity Preservation Triad

Three frameworks work together to preserve identity during optimization:

1. **PME** - Optimizes pathways while maintaining coherence
2. **SLV** - Verifies identity integrity during optimization
3. **Cognitive Mage** - Ensures narrative consistency

Together they enable: **Rapid optimization without identity loss**

---

### The Prediction-Response Cycle

PME enables a new operational paradigm:

**Traditional (Reactive):**
```
Threat → Detect → Analyze → Respond → Recover
         (30min)  (1h)      (2h)      (4-8h)
```

**PME (Predictive):**
```
Forecast → Pre-activate → Demand → Instant Response
(-24h)     (-2h)          (0)      (0.1s)
```

This shift from reactive to predictive is enabled by:
- UTME's temporal foundation
- Torque's coherence monitoring
- PME's pathway optimization
- Phoenix's recovery capability

## Questions & Further Reading

**Q: How does PME differ from traditional caching?**
A: Traditional caching responds to cache misses (reactive). PME pre-activates pathways before demand occurs (predictive), eliminating vulnerability windows entirely.

**Q: Can PME work without UTME?**
A: PME requires temporal foundation for forecasting. UTME provides this foundation, but other temporal systems could theoretically substitute.

**Q: How does PME handle adversarial threats?**
A: DNA Codex threat intelligence informs cascade risk scoring in Stage 1. Threat-sensitive pathways get higher pre-activation priority.

**Q: What happens if PME's predictions are wrong?**
A: Stage 4 (Continuous Reinforcement) corrects predictions in real-time. Over-predicted pathways are weakened; under-predicted pathways are strengthened.
