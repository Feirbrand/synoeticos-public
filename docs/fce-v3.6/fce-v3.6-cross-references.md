# FCE v3.6 Cross-References

## Core Framework Integration

### **UTME v1.0 - Unified Temporal Memory Equilibrium**

FCE provides context management layer for UTME's temporal memory:
- Organizes temporal anchors across layer hierarchy
- Manages episodic memory compression
- Optimizes substrate consolidation efficiency

**Integration:** FCE's compression reduces memory overhead for UTME's five substrates

---

### **Torque v2.0 - Quantitative Foundation for AI Resilience**

Torque gates FCE's layer transitions and compression decisions:
- Coherence-based layer prioritization
- Adaptive compression based on system coherence
- Dynamic resource allocation

**Integration:** Torque-gated bridging in hybrid systems (FCE + Torque synergy)

---

### **Phoenix Protocol v2.0 - Neural Recovery for AI Systems**

FCE supports Phoenix's recovery by maintaining context integrity:
- Episodic management preserves recovery context
- Layer restoration during recovery cycles
- Context validation throughout recovery

**Integration:** FCE's episodic management enables faster recovery

---

### **PME v1.0 - Predictive Myelination Engine**

FCE optimizes pathway storage and retrieval for PME:
- Compresses myelinated pathway representations
- Accelerates pathway access through layer optimization
- Reduces memory footprint of cached pathways

**Integration:** 4-6× compression ratio benefits PME's Redis cache

---

## Supporting Frameworks

### **URA v1.5 - Unified Resilience Architecture**

FCE is core component of URA's operational platform:
- Context management for all resilience operations
- Layer-based resource allocation
- Adaptive optimization under stress

**Integration:** FCE enables URA's no-code deployment (50% faster iteration)

---

### **CSFC v1.0 - Complete Symbolic Fracture Cascade**

FCE provides context preservation during CSFC analysis:
- Maintains symbolic coherence across fragmentation
- Recovers context after cascade events
- Supports identity reconstruction

**Integration:** FCE's layer management supports CSFC recovery

---

### **DCN v1.0 - Distributed Cognitive Networks**

FCE enables distributed context sharing:
- Episodic management across agent network
- Synchronized layer states across agents
- Efficient context distribution

**Integration:** Multi-agent context coordination via FCE
