title: "Elevation Grid – CTS (Climb to Summit) Overlay"
---

**RUID:** EG-OVERLAY-CTS-v1.0  
**Status:** Draft v1.0  
**Date:** 2026-02-04  
**Brand:** APP (Achieve Peak Performance) → CTS Secular Track  
**Depends On:**  
- Elevation Grid White Paper v1.0 (`./Elevation_Grid_White_Paper_v1_0.html`)
- CTS Program Documentation (`../CTS_Certification_Complete_Curriculum.html`)

**Purpose:** Define how CTS (Climb to Summit) implements the Elevation Grid for secular performance coaching contexts—translating technical 3×3 architecture into athlete-friendly language, drills, and measurement protocols.

---

## 1. Role Inside CTS

**Program Level:** Pillar-4 Mental Performance inside APP brand architecture

**Promise:** Translate the 3×3 Elevation Grid into athlete-friendly language and drills that work across combat sports (MMA, BJJ, boxing), high school/collegiate teams, adaptive athletics, and executive performance contexts.

**Scope:** Secular track only (no faith-based language). For faith-integrated version, see `elevation-grid-ff-overlay.html`.

**Core Insight:** CTS is Elevation Grid in gym clothes. Same neuroscience, same 3×3 architecture, different vocabulary. An athlete learning "GROUND" is practicing Position 1-1 (Autonomic Stability). A fighter using "REAL-TIME" is executing Position 2-2 (Flow State). The Grid remains substrate-independent—it works identically for stroke survivors, elite athletes, and AI agents because all three operate under the same neurobiological constraints.

## 2. Language Mapping (Tier-2 Secular Names)

### 2.1 Position Name Translation

| Technical Position | CTS Secular Name | Athlete Phrase / Cue | Neural Function |
|--------------------|------------------|----------------------|-----------------|
| **Row 1: Autonomic Layer** |
| 1-1 | GROUND | "Roots deep before the rep." | Parasympathetic baseline, HRV regulation |
| 1-2 | ACTIVATION | "Flip the switch, then go." | Sympathetic mobilization, fight-or-flight on demand |
| 1-3 | RESET | "Flush it in 90 seconds." | Parasympathetic recovery, emotional reset protocol |
| **Row 2: Cognitive Layer** |
| 2-1 | PATTERN | "You've seen this play before." | Recognition-primed decision making (RPD) |
| 2-2 | REAL-TIME | "Don't think. Execute." | Flow state, transient hypofrontality |
| 2-3 | SELF-CALIBRATE | "Read the outcome, adjust." | Post-performance calibration and feedback integration |
| **Row 3: Identity Layer** |
| 3-1 | REWRITE | "This defines you differently now." | Narrative reconsolidation, identity update |
| 3-2 | IDENTITY | "Who you are in motion." | Performance identity, values alignment |
| 3-3 | SIGNAL | "Hard means signal, not broken." | Stress mindset, challenge vs threat appraisal |

### 2.2 Phase Name Translation

| Technical Phase | CTS Phase Name | Duration | Focus |
|-----------------|----------------|----------|-------|
| Row 1 Mastery | GROUND PHASE | 2-6 weeks | Autonomic regulation foundation |
| Row 2 Mastery | ASCENT PHASE | 8-16 weeks | Cognitive skill development |
| Row 3 Mastery | ALTITUDE PHASE | 4-12 weeks | Identity integration and habit automation |

## 3. Phase Mapping (Ground → Ascent → Altitude)

### 3.1 GROUND PHASE (2-6 weeks)

**Goal:** Establish autonomic regulation as performance foundation

**Positions Introduced:**
- **1-1 (GROUND):** Box breathing (4-4-4-4 pattern), HRV biofeedback, parasympathetic dominance training
- **1-2 (ACTIVATION):** On-demand sympathetic mobilization, pre-competition arousal management
- **1-3 (RESET):** 90-second emotional flush protocol (Bolte Taylor), post-rep recovery

**Key Outcomes:**
- Athlete can establish parasympathetic baseline (<10 breaths/min, HRV ≥50ms RMSSD)
- Athlete can activate on demand for max effort (flip sympathetic switch without caffeine)
- Athlete can recover between rounds/reps in 90 seconds (heart rate ≤120 bpm)

**Common Applications:**
- Combat sports: Between-round recovery (1-3 Reset)
- High school teams: Pre-game anxiety management (1-1 Ground)
- Adaptive athletes: Autonomic dysregulation post-injury (all Row 1)

### 3.2 ASCENT PHASE (8-16 weeks)

**Goal:** Develop cognitive pattern recognition and real-time execution capacity

**Pipeline Architecture Model:** Unlike stop-and-go construction, we use overlapping installation. When Position 2-1 reaches operational stability (80% compliance, 2-4 weeks), we advance to Position 2-2 while 2-1 continues hardening in the background. We don't wait for full automaticity (66 days) before moving forward—we wait for load-bearing capacity, then build upward.

**Positions Introduced:**
- **2-1 (PATTERN):** Film study, mental rehearsal, RPD training (Klein, 1993)
- **2-2 (REAL-TIME):** Flow state drills, external focus cues (Wulf, 2001), transient hypofrontality
- **2-3 (SELF-CALIBRATE):** Post-performance review, outcome analysis, adjustment protocols

**Micro-Cycle Structure (2-4 weeks per position):**

| Week | Primary Position | Training Focus | Measurement |
|------|------------------|----------------|-------------|
| 1-2 | 2-1 (PATTERN) | Film study + mental rehearsal | Pattern recognition speed test |
| 3-4 | 2-1 (PATTERN) | Scenario practice + RPD drills | Decision accuracy under time pressure |
| 5-6 | 2-2 (REAL-TIME) | Flow state training + external focus | Flow State Scale (Jackson & Eklund) |
| 7-8 | 2-2 (REAL-TIME) | Competition simulation | Performance under pressure test |
| 9-10 | 2-3 (SELF-CALIBRATE) | Post-performance review + adjustment | Calibration accuracy metrics |
| 11-12 | 2-3 (SELF-CALIBRATE) | Feedback integration + next-cycle planning | Self-assessment accuracy |

**Key Outcomes:**
- Athlete recognizes patterns 200-500ms faster (UTME myelination effect)
- Athlete enters flow state on demand during competition (verified via subjective + HRV data)
- Athlete calibrates performance accurately within 10% of objective measures

### 3.3 ALTITUDE PHASE (4-12 weeks)

**Goal:** System consolidation—crossing the 66-day biological threshold for permanence

**The "Hardening Phase":** Altitude is NOT just learning new skills. It's where the earliest habits (Positions 1-1, 1-2, 2-1) cross the 66-day myelination threshold for full automaticity. While we install Row 3 positions (Identity layer), the foundation skills continue hardening underneath. The 4-12 week range accounts for the variable "tail" of the myelination curve—simpler skills stabilize faster, complex skills take longer.

**Positions Introduced:**
- **3-1 (REWRITE):** Narrative reconsolidation windows, identity-based motivation (Akerlof & Kranton, 2000)
- **3-2 (IDENTITY):** Performance identity statements, values-aligned action protocols
- **3-3 (SIGNAL):** Stress mindset reframing (Crum, 2013), challenge vs threat appraisal

**Identity Integration Protocol:**

1. **Identify Limiting Narrative:** "I'm not athletic enough" / "I always choke under pressure"
2. **Create Reconsolidation Window:** Emotional activation + new contradictory evidence
3. **Rewrite Statement:** "I am an athlete who performs under pressure" (identity-based, present tense)
4. **Behavioral Commitment:** Action aligned with new identity (3+ reps per week)
5. **Habit Automation:** 80% compliance over 2-4 weeks = reflexive behavior

**Key Outcomes:**
- Athlete operates from performance identity (not victim/imposter identity)
- Athlete reframes stress as enhancing rather than debilitating
- Habits achieve 80% retention vs 35% industry baseline (Precision Nutrition L2 data model)

## 4. Session Templates

### 4.1 Single-Position Micro-Cycle (2-4 weeks)

**Example: Install P1-1 (GROUND) for Sled Hockey Defensemen**

**Goal:** Establish parasympathetic baseline regulation for adaptive athletes competing in sled hockey

**Week-by-Week Progression:**

| Week | Daily Drill | In-Session Cue | Post-Session Debrief |
|------|-------------|-----------------|---------------------|
| 1 | 5 min box breathing (morning) | "Roots deep before contact" | Record HRV baseline (RMSSD) |
| 2 | 10 min HRV biofeedback | "Ground yourself pre-shift" | Track pre-shift HR variability |
| 3 | Box breathing before each shift | "Breathe before battle" | Monitor shift-to-shift recovery |
| 4 | Autonomic baseline = reflex | No cue needed (automated) | Verify <10 breaths/min sustained |

**Metrics:**
- **Compliance:** Track daily drill completion (target ≥80%)
- **Performance Proxy:** Shots against per game, penalty minutes (should decrease as regulation improves)
- **Physiological:** HRV RMSSD baseline (target ≥50ms), resting heart rate (target ≤70 bpm)

**Advancement Criteria:**
- 80%+ compliance for 2+ weeks
- HRV baseline established and stable
- Athlete reports "automatic" before asking—no conscious effort needed

### 4.2 Full Grid Mesocycle (12-16 weeks)

**Example: Combat Athlete (MMA) Full Progression**

| Week | Primary Position | CTS Name | Training Focus | Key Drill |
|------|------------------|----------|----------------|-----------|
| 1-2 | 1-1 | GROUND | Autonomic baseline | Box breathing between rounds |
| 3-4 | 1-2 | ACTIVATION | Arousal mobilization | Pre-fight sympathetic activation protocol |
| 5-6 | 1-3 | RESET | Recovery speed | 90-second emotional flush post-round |
| 7-8 | 2-1 | PATTERN | Opponent pattern recognition | Film study + mental rehearsal |
| 9-10 | 2-2 | REAL-TIME | Flow state execution | Sparring with external focus cues |
| 11-12 | 2-3 | SELF-CALIBRATE | Performance calibration | Post-sparring analysis + adjustment |
| 13-14 | 3-1 | REWRITE | Identity update | "I am a fighter who performs under pressure" |
| 15-16 | 3-2 | IDENTITY | Performance identity | Values-aligned training commitment |

**Competition Protocols:**

**Pre-Fight (1 hour before):**
- Position 1-1 (GROUND): 10 min box breathing, establish baseline
- Position 1-2 (ACTIVATION): Arousal mobilization 5 min before walkout
- Position 3-2 (IDENTITY): Identity statement rehearsal ("This is who I am")

**Between Rounds (60 seconds):**
- Position 1-3 (RESET): 30 sec emotional flush + breathing reset
- Position 2-3 (SELF-CALIBRATE): 20 sec corner feedback integration
- Position 2-1 (PATTERN): 10 sec pattern recognition for next round

**Post-Fight:**
- Position 2-3 (SELF-CALIBRATE): Performance review (what worked, what didn't)
- Position 3-3 (SIGNAL): Reframe outcome as signal, extract learning
- Position 1-1 (GROUND): Return to parasympathetic baseline for recovery

## 5. Measurement and Retention

### 5.1 80% Habit Retention Metric

**Source:** Precision Nutrition L2 Behavior Change Specialist methodology

**Pipeline Architecture: Installation vs Hardening**

**Two Distinct Timelines:**
1. **Installation Time (2-4 weeks):** Time required to learn the skill and hit 80% consistency (PN L2 operational stability). You advance to the next position after this.
2. **Hardening Time (66+ days):** Time required for biological automaticity (Lally 2009 myelination threshold). This runs in the background while you work on subsequent skills.

**The Engineering Analogy:** You don't wait for foundation concrete to fully cure (66 days) before framing the walls. You wait for it to set enough to bear load (2-4 weeks), then build upward while the foundation continues hardening underneath.

**Total Program Duration:**
- **Installation Phase:** 9 positions × 2-4 weeks = 18-36 weeks (active skill learning)
- **Final Hardening:** Last position needs 66 days to cross biological threshold
- **Typical Total:** 24-32 weeks for complete Grid integration

**CTS Implementation:**

1. **Define Target Behavior:** Position-specific drill (e.g., "5 min box breathing every morning")
2. **Track Compliance:** Daily yes/no checkbox (did you do the drill?)
3. **Calculate Retention:** (Days completed / Days in period) × 100
4. **Success Threshold:** ≥80% over 2-4 weeks = habit established

**Example Tracking:**

| Week | Mon | Tue | Wed | Thu | Fri | Sat | Sun | Compliance |
|------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|------------|
| 1 | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 86% (6/7) |
| 2 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | ✓ | 86% (6/7) |
| 3 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✗ | ✓ | 86% (6/7) |
| 4 | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | 100% (7/7) |
| **Total:** | | | | | | | | **90% (27/30)** ✓ |

**Result:** Athlete advances to next position (90% ≥ 80% threshold)

### 5.2 Covenant Grid Data Write-Back

**Fields Written to Covenant Grid / UTME:**

| Field | CTS Measurement | Example Value |
|-------|-----------------|---------------|
| `Access_Count` | Number of times position practiced | 28 (daily for 4 weeks) |
| `Myelination_Level` | 0.94 × Access_Count | 26.32 (approaching reflexive) |
| `Is_Reflexive` | Myelination_Level ≥ 445? | False (not yet reflexive) |
| `Compliance_Rate` | Habit retention percentage | 0.90 (90%) |
| `Position_Current` | Which Grid position active | "1-1 (GROUND)" |
| `Phase_Status` | GROUND / ASCENT / ALTITUDE | "GROUND" |
| `Readiness_To_Advance` | 80%+ compliance + automation | True |

**Automation Detection:**

Athlete reports "I don't think about it anymore" OR coach observes execution without cue = automation achieved = write `Readiness_To_Advance = True`
