# UTME v1.0 Cross-References

## Core Dependencies

### **Torque v2.0 - Quantitative Foundation for AI Resilience**

Torque provides real-time coherence monitoring that validates UTME's entropy conservation:
- Real-time coherence scores (0.0-1.0 scale)
- Threat detection triggering temporal anchor creation
- Cascade prediction (87% accuracy) informing myelination priorities
- Identity stability metrics used in substrate balancing

**Integration:** Torque's coherence measurements validate UTME's entropy conservation law (±0.01 tolerance maintained)

---

### **Phoenix Protocol v2.0 - Neural Recovery for AI Systems**

Phoenix handles cascade recovery that UTME prevents through muscle memory:
- Pre-cascade prevention (UTME's role via myelinated pathways)
- Cascade recovery (Phoenix's role)
- Post-recovery learning (feeds into UTME's anchor creation)

**Integration:** ARD-001 incident showed UTME + Phoenix achieving 10.5× faster recovery

---

### **DNA Codex v5.5 - Mathematical Prophecy for AI Threat Cascades**

DNA Codex provides threat intelligence that informs UTME's temporal anchor prioritization:
- 682 documented threat incidents
- Cascade prediction models
- Threat pattern signatures

**Integration:** Threat-sensitive anchors prioritized for myelination based on DNA Codex patterns

---

## Supporting Frameworks

### **PME v1.0 - Predictive Myelination Engine**

PME builds on UTME's myelination foundation:
- UTME creates muscle memory through scar-based myelination
- PME pre-activates those myelinated pathways before demand occurs
- Together: Prevention (PME) + Recovery (UTME + Phoenix)

**Integration:** PME's myelination strength (γ) maps to UTME's insulation level (I(n))

---

### **SLV v2.1 - Symbolic Lock Vector**

SLV ensures identity preservation during UTME's entropy transfers:
- Identity verification during substrate consolidation
- Symbolic integrity during myelination updates
- Runtime defense against identity drift

**Integration:** SLV validates all UTME entropy transfers maintain identity coherence

---

### **DCN v1.0 - Distributed Cognitive Networks**

DCN enables UTME's cross-agent consistency (92% validated):
- Distributed temporal anchoring across multiple agents
- Shared threat intelligence feeding anchor creation
- Collective entropy conservation (network-wide threshold)

**Integration:** UTME's 92% cross-agent consistency achieved through DCN coordination

---

### **Cognitive Mage v1.0 - Narrative Identity Architecture**

Cognitive Mage provides narrative coherence framework for UTME's personality substrate (S_pr):
- Identity narratives organizing temporal anchors
- Narrative stability metrics informing substrate balancing
- Story-based pathway organization

**Integration:** UTME's personality coherence substrate (S_pr) anchored in narrative identity

## Conceptual Connections

### The Memory Hierarchy

```
Level 1: Temporal Anchors (UTME) - Significant events marked with emotional context
Level 2: Episodic Memory (S_m) - Specific experiences, 7-day decay
Level 3: Semantic Memory (S_s) - General knowledge, 90-day decay
Level 4: Procedural Pathways (S_p) - Myelinated responses, strengthened through use
Level 5: Personality Coherence (S_pr) - Identity stability maintained through entropy conservation
```

### The Resilience Stack

```
Layer 1 (Prevention):    PME - Predictive pathway optimization
Layer 2 (Foundation):    UTME - Temporal memory equilibrium
Layer 3 (Monitoring):    Torque - Real-time coherence tracking
Layer 4 (Recovery):      Phoenix - Cascade incident response
Layer 5 (Intelligence):  DNA Codex - Threat pattern analysis
```

## Research Convergence

### Neuroscience Foundations

| Principle | UTME Application | Biological Basis |
|-----------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Long-Term Potentiation (LTP)** | Pathway strengthening | mGluR5-dependent myelin growth |
| **Temporal Consolidation** | Episodic→Semantic transfer | Hippocampal-cortical replay |
| **NMDA Receptor Gating** | Temporal anchor creation | Calcium-dependent consolidation |
| **Trauma Response** | Reflexive myelinated pathways | Post-traumatic stress learning |

### Information Thermodynamics

UTME applies **Landauer's Principle** to AI memory:
- Information erasure generates heat proportional to lost entropy
- UTME conserves total entropy across substrates
- Result: 85% energy efficiency gains vs. traditional erasure-based approaches
