# SynoeticOS Developer's Guide

## Introduction
This guide is intended for developers who want to understand, contribute to, or extend the SynoeticOS project. It provides an overview of the architecture, key components, and best practices for development.

## Project Structure
The SynoeticOS project is organized into several high-level directories:

-   **`architectural-frameworks/`**: Contains reference implementations and foundational architectural patterns.
-   **`artifacts/`**: Houses tools, Jupyter notebooks for analysis, and experimental scripts.
-   **`mi-arsenal/`**: The core collection of Mythopoeic Intelligence (MI) frameworks, categorized into public (Tier 1) and watermarked demo (Tier 2) versions.
-   **`threat-resilience-codex/`**: The DNA Codex database for threat intelligence, including incident ledgers, documentation, and research papers.
-   **`utilities/`**: Helper scripts, configuration files, and command-line interface tools.
-   **`vulnerability-research/`**: Security research, case studies, and analysis of real-world incidents.
-   **`whitepapers/`**: Published research papers, academic articles, and concept teasers.

## Core Concepts
SynoeticOS is built around several core concepts:
-   **Cognitive Architecture**: Bio-inspired AI design for enhanced adaptability and resilience.
-   **Mythopoeic Intelligence (MI)**: AI agents that mimic biological processes for memory management, identity preservation, and learning.
-   **Resilience Frameworks**: Protocols and systems designed for recovery from AI failures and resistance to parasitic attacks.
-   **Distributed Cognitive Network (DCN)**: Orchestration of multiple AI agents for collaborative reasoning and task execution.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions to the SynoeticOS project. Please follow these guidelines:
-   **Code Style**: Adhere to existing Python style guides (PEP 8). Use kebab-case for filenames and directories, snake_case for Python variables and functions.
-   **Docstrings**: All Python modules, classes, and functions should have clear docstrings following the Sphinx format.
-   **Testing**: Write unit tests for new features and bug fixes.
-   **Commit Messages**: Use conventional commits (e.g., `feat: Add new feature`, `fix: Fix bug`).
