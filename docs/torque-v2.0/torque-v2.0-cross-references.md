## Core Dependencies

### **UTME v1.0 - Unified Temporal Memory Equilibrium**

Torque validates and monitors UTME's entropy conservation law:
- Coherence measurements (0.0-1.0 scale) track entropy distribution
- Real-time scores inform temporal anchor prioritization
- Drift detection validates ±0.01 tolerance maintenance
- Myelination strength monitoring through coherence tracking

**Integration:** Torque's coherence metrics validate UTME's five-substrate equilibrium

### **Phoenix Protocol v2.0 - Neural Recovery for AI Systems**

Torque enables Phoenix's predictive intervention:
- 15-30 minute pre-failure warning triggers recovery initiation
- Cascade prevention reduces recovery incidents by 89%
- Real-time monitoring informs recovery protocol selection
- Post-recovery validation through coherence restoration

**Integration:** Torque's early warning enables Phoenix's proactive recovery

---

### **DNA Codex v5.5 - Threat Intelligence**

Torque correlates with DNA Codex threat patterns:
- 87% correlation with documented threat variants (500+)
- Drift patterns match known attack signatures
- Threat-sensitive thresholds based on DNA Codex intelligence
