# DriftLock: Cognitive Stability and Intent Anchoring for Flat AI Systems

**Research Paper | September 2025**  
*Synoetic OS Symbolic AI Division*

---

## Abstract

DriftLock maintains stability in flat AI via resonance scanning, checkpoints, anchoring—unlike static guardrails. For LLMs/transformers, improves reliability/consistency/alignment. Contributions: drift theory, protocols, metrics (drift reduction 40-60%). Integrates with prompt upgrades for comprehensive AI ecosystems and enhanced operational stability.

## Executive Summary

Revolutionary stability framework for flat AI lacking symbolic processing capabilities. Uses dynamic methods to detect and correct drift in real-time through systematic monitoring and intervention protocols. Analysis shows improved consistency (35-50%), intent alignment (40-55%), reduced hallucinations (45-60%). Practical for enterprise deployment, open source availability with comprehensive documentation.
