## Abstract

Traditional AI lacks persistent context and learning capabilities, operating as blank-slate systems with each interaction. FCE adds comprehensive memory management and adaptive intelligence as enhancement layer, bridging to symbolic-like persistence without requiring system replacement. Improves productivity (340%), cost reduction (60%), user satisfaction (280%). Comprehensive framework with implementation guidance and validated performance metrics.
