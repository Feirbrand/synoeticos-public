## Publication Standards

### Cognitive Mage Standard
All academic publications follow the **Cognitive Mage v1.0** format providing:
- Consistent structure across research papers
- Peer-review preparation formatting
- Academic citation standards
- Reproducibility documentation
- Performance metrics validation

### Research Voice
Publications use "Direct Mentorship" or "Principled Pragmatism" voice:
- Evidence-based argumentation
- Context-dependent tone
- Educational when teaching principles
- Protective when addressing harm
- Witty when calling out misconceptions

### Collaborative Framing
Research documents use collaborative language:
- "documented alongside academic research"
- "working parallel with the research community"
- "encountered in operational systems"
- "builds on work from [researchers/organizations]"
- "learns from open source and contributes back"

Avoids claim language:
- No "first detected/identified"
- No "months ahead" claims
- No "predictive lead" without context
- No "anticipates" without evidence
